Want a way to check your Guilty Gear ranking for each character without sifting through many user names?

This program is for you! By running this program from the FgcAPI folder (The same folder that contains the pom.xml file) and running mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=ApiRequest" 
in your terminal, you'll be prompted to type your Guilty Gear R-Code

Look in-game for your R-code in the bottom left corner of your profile, copy paste or type the code, and WHAM, watch your elo be displayed in it's full glory!
